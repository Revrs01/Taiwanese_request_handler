Taibun Request Handler

## Why we need this ?
Taibun server is not stable, so we make the structure of the Correction System into microservices. This is the request handler that handle user requests to the corresponding server

#### The Request Handler is running on `140.116.245.154`

## RUN
```sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

## STOP
```sh
docker compose down
```
